                     <h4><a name="_Toc456086552"></a>10 COLLECTION OF WASTE</h4>
                     <p style="font-weight: 400;">(a) Waste shall be collected at the time and Site, as the Parties may agree from time to time. At the time of collection, the Waste shall be weighed by AGORA and the weight of such Waste shall be verified by the representatives of AGORA. The weight of such Waste shall be noted in the Consignment Note. A copy of the Consignment Note shall be given by AGORA to the Customer and shall be conclusive evidence of collection of the Waste described therein including its weight. The Parties hereby agree that the weight of Waste as stated by AGORA’s weighing equipment shall be final and conclusive.</p>
                     <p style="font-weight: 400;">(b) In the event that AGORA subsequently determines that:</p>
                     <p style="font-weight: 400;">(i) any of the waste collected from the Site includes any wastes for which AGORA is not licensed to provide any treatment or disposal service under the laws of Malaysia including but not limited to the Malaysian Environmental Quality Act 1974 and regulations thereunder; and/or</p>
                     <p style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) the Waste are in condition such that it will increase the extent of hazard, or risk undertaken by AGORA,</p>
                     <p style="font-weight: 400;">then AGORA reserves the right to revoke its acceptance of such waste as made at collection from the Site and such revocation will operate to revest the Transportation Risk to the Customer as if such Transportation Risk had never been passed to AGORA. For the avoidance of doubt, all risks and liability including but not limited to the ownership, title, and all other incidents of ownership related risks whatsoever, shall remain and be borne by the Customer. In such event, AGORA shall arrange for the lawful transportation and return of such waste to the Customer at the Site within a reasonable time after notice of revocation of acceptance has been communicated to the Customer unless the Parties agree to an alternative lawful manner of disposal of such waste. The Customer shall pay AGORA for all expenses incurred by AGORA in relation to the return of such waste including but not limited to the handling, transporting, and storing of such waste, or agreed alternative disposal, and charges for any work done by AGORA prior to the revocation of the acceptance by AGORA. All risks, liabilities and costs arising from the foregoing shall be borne by the Customer.</p>
